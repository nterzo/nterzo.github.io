## About Me

I am a Doctoral Researcher in the Cryptographic Engineering group led by [Peter Schwabe](https://cryptojedi.org/peter/index.shtml) at the [Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy](https://www.mpi-sp.org/). My research deals with the security analysis of cryptographic protocols, through the use of formal verification and cryptanalysis.

Previously, I completed both my MSc and BSc degrees in Computer Engineering at [Polytechnic University of Turin](https://www.polito.it/en) and [University of Calabria](https://www.unical.it/?lang=en) respectively. 

My Master's thesis, titled "Design and in-orbit Demonstration of a Post-Quantum Cryptographic Solution Based on KEMTLS-PDK to Enhance Satellite Communication Security", is available [here](assets/dissertation.pdf).

During my studies, I completed two internships as a Cybersecurity Engineer in the Italian Army (Rome, Italy) and at the European Space Agency (Darmstadt, Germany).
